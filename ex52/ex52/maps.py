your entire crew. You are the last surviving member and your last
mission is to get the neutron bomb from the Weapons Armory,
put it in the bridge, and blow up the ship after getting into an
escape pod.

You're running down the central corridor to the Weapons Armory when
a Gothon jumps out, red scaly skin, dark grimy teeth, and an evil
clown costume flowing around his hate filled body. He's blocking the
door to the Armory and about to pull a weapon to blast you.

Lucky for you they made you learn Gothon insults in the academy.

The Gothon stops, tries not to laugh, then bursts out laughing and can't move.
While he's laughing you run up and shoot him square in the head, then jump through
the Weapon Armory door.

You do a dive roll into the Weapon Armory, crouch and scan the room
for more Gothons that might be hiding. It's dead quiet... too quiet.
You stand up and run to the far side of the room and find the 
neutron bomb in its container. There's a keypad lock on the box
and you need the code to get the bomb out. Luckily, you have your
tricorder device which will return 3 possible codes you can use, but
you only have one chance at it, else the lock will close forever.

Now that the bomb is placed, you run to the escape pod to
get off this tin can.

You rush through the ship desperately trying to make it to 
the escape pod before the whole ship explodes. It seems like
hardly any Gothons are on the ship, so your run is clear of
